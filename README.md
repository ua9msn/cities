Cities game on node.js 

Install and play
=====

Clone it, install it, play it

  node server.js
```

Development and config
======

As it the first and little buggy version, some configs are inplace and hardcoded. I know... Do not bothering me.
For now gameplay turned on for USA cities. With easy modification it can be changed as well.
 
Future
=====

If i'll have a time, may be i make it totally multiplayer. But at first, of course, 
i will make a login, register, profiles, scores etc. If i'll have a time, again.
